This folder contains the spreadsheet `5y-setup.ods`.

**This spreadsheet is not finalised yet**

The spreadsheet assumes that the publishing platform will be rolled out over 5 years. 

There are about 100 parameters which can be varied. The cells of these parameters have a white background.
Other values are calculated from these values. They cannot be varied directly. These cells have a grey background. 

Some parameters are basically free choice, e.g. the number of projected series. Other parameters have values more or less dictated by the powers that be, e.g. the salary for a scientist at a public institution often depends on a payscale roster which cannot be changed from within the project. 

The project will run at a loss in the beginning (like most projects, commercial and non-commercial alike). These costs have to be met either by initial grants, or by loans which will be paid back by surpluses in later years. Given that the target group is the non-profit sector, whe do not consider loans a serious option since we cannot expect that scientists vouch for a loan of >100.000 EUR. 

Revenue is broken down according to the 5 revenue streams established in the business model. 

Costs are broken down into fixed/variable and personnel/non-personnel costs. 

The current setup assumes that all employees will fit into one room, and that 3 desks and computers will be needed. This could be adjusted, but it would only have little influence on the overall outcome. 

The individual variables are: 
- `Pages per book`: How many pages do your books have on average?
- `Tables per book`: How many tables are found in a book on average? 
- `Figures per book`: How many figures are found in a book on average?
- `DOIs per book`: How many DOIs do you need for a book? This combines DOIs for the book and DOIs for subparts such as chapters
- `ISBNs per book`: How many ISBNs do you need per book? Digital and paper edition need different ISBNs, as do softcover and hardcover ISBNs. 
- `own copies per book`: How many copies do you need for yourself, your institution, and your national libraries etc? 
- `cost price pod setup`: How much does it cost to start a print-on-demand project? 
- `cost price page`:  How much does your print-on-demand service provider charge per b/w page. 
- `Percentage community proofreading`: How much of the proofreading is crowd-sourced to the community? 
- `Percentage outsourced proofreading `: How much proofreading is outsorced? 
- `percentage inhouse proofreading `:  This follows from the above two items
- `Percentage community typesetting`: How much of the typesetting is crowdsourced to the community?
- `percentage outsourced typesetting `: How much of the typesetting is outsourced? 
- `percentage inhouse typesetting `:  This follows from the above two items
- `percentage outsourced indexing`: How much of indexing is outsourced? 
- `percentage inhouse indexing`:  This follows from the item above
- `Downloads per book`: How many downloads do you expect per book on average?
