\chapter{prime the pump}

The most important take-home message is: you have about 2-3 years after the launch to build up enough prestige to keep rolling. 
After that period, you either have a steady stream of submissions, or your project is all but dead. 

Success begets success, and nothing attracts the crowd like the crowd. You want to be seen as the place to be, as the place where everyone flocks to. Every new publication should lead to a number of follow-up proposals from readers who have become interested in the press. The problem with books is that they take a year to write and a year to review and produce. This means that the follow-up books will come out about 2 years after the book which prompted them. In other words, the period from generation to generation is two years. 

For Language Science Press, we can distinguish three ``waves'' of proposals: 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item starting books (5). These are manuscripts invited by the press directors and are available for publication within the first year after launch
 \item second wave (12). These are submissions from authors who have seen the publication of the first books.
 \item third wave and beyond (50): Submissions from authors who have seen a second-wave or later book. 
\end{enumerate}
\todo{check numbers}

Your operations can be seen as steady when you have reached the third generation of proposals, i.e. follow-up submissions on follow-up books on the starting books. At that point in time, the generations become less clearly distinguished, and quick books from the fourth generation might come out earlier than latecomers from the third generation. Your initial funding should allow you to get to the publication of a third generation book.

A number of conclusions follow from these premises:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item You should have a book publication out ONE DAY AFTER your initial funding starts to attract second-generation proposals early. 
 \item Your first publications should be of very high quality, and should be as speedy as possible without sacrificing quality. A delay in first-generation books will set you back for all future generations, in terms of time and in terms of quantity.
 \item You must make sure that the starting books get maximal exposure in all relevant venues in order to produce follow-up submissions. For the first three generations, you want exponential growth. After that, linear growth will do. 
\end{enumerate}

Normally, you will not be able to adjust your staffing according to the number of books. This means that in the beginning, there will be relatively fewer books per person to work on than later on. Use this leeway to create beautiful hand-crafted books and as pleasant as an experience for the authors as possible. Once the ball gets rolling and you attract more submissions, you will have to scale down that level of dedication, but at that point in time, you will hopefully be in a position to be selective with regard to the submissions you accept. 

In the beginning, we had some edited volumes where chapters were written in various versions of Microsoft Word, with no particular template, and no consistent or coherent formatting. We adapted all of those to a uniform style and spent enormous amounts of time on this. As a result, we attracted more submissions, and we are now able to enforce our templates and guidelines, and can afford refusing submissions which do not comply. As the number of books in production goes up, the time we have available for each book goes down, but at the same time, the submissions are in much better shape and require less time overall as well.
